## [0.9.0] - 2025-01-06

### ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Comprehensive Step-by-Step Tester
**Status:** Broken - preprocessing failures

### Added
- Complete 8-step hydrologic analysis framework
- GRASS r.watershed integration
- Flow path tracing with r.path
- Hydraulic length calculation
- Comprehensive error handling

### Issues Identified
- Complex tool chain caused preprocessing failures
- Multiple external dependencies (GRASS/SAGA)
- Difficult to isolate specific failure points
- Not suitable for troubleshooting approach

### Resolution
- Replaced with single-step tester (v1.0.0)
- Preserved as reference for future comprehensive tool

## [0.8.0] - 2025-01-06

### ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Enhanced Hydrologic Analysis
**Status:** Broken - preprocessing failures

### Added
- Advanced hydrologic analysis with GRASS/SAGA tools
- Real flow path extraction
- DEM-based slope calculation
- Multi-threaded processing
- Enhanced GUI with advanced settings

### Issues Identified
- "Enhanced calculation failed" during preprocessing
- DEM preprocessing step caused failures
- Complex tool dependencies
- Difficult error diagnosis

### Lessons Learned
- Complex multi-step approaches need individual step validation
- GRASS/SAGA tools may not be available in all QGIS installations
- Need fallback methods for each processing step

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-06

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Fixed Basic Version
**Status:** Functional but with issues

### Added
- Fixed GUI opening issues
- Removed Hydro Suite references
- User-selectable inputs (no hardcoded paths)
- Basic flow length estimation

### Issues Identified
- Flow length: 1,456 ft for 0.65-acre basin (unrealistic)
- Used 0.5% default slope (unscientific)
- TC result: 39 minutes (too high for small urban basin)
- Geometric estimation instead of hydrologic analysis

### User Feedback
- "Flow length estimation and assumption of 0.5% slope is too general"
- "Basin S1 is 0.65 acres, entire basin is just over 400 feet wide and 100 ft in depth"
- "This is too large for a dense residential 1/8th acre development"
- "Need to utilize QGIS tools to calculate flow length and slope"

---

## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-06

### ‚ùå REJECTED: Simplified Empirical Version
**Status:** Unscientific approach

### Added
- Simplified geometric calculations
- Area-based flow length formulas
- Reduced complexity for reliability

### Issues Identified
- "No real scientific backing"
- "Empirical formulas simplified for basic calculations"
- Used minimum slope defaults instead of DEM analysis
- Not acceptable for professional hydrologic analysis

### User Feedback
- "This simplified approach has no real scientific backing"
- "Slope shall be the average basin slope and flow length will be the hydraulic length"
- "These calculations should be working in QGIS"
